# Local Development

## Checklist before publishing the package

 - Make sure to update `REQUIRED` and `EXTRAS` list in `setup.py` based on what's required by the library and what's required only for development. To ease local development, we will continue to maintain `requirements.txt` which includes every package.
 - Bump the verion constant `VERSION` in `setup.py`
 - Run setup test
    - `python setup.py test`
 - Publish package to PyPI
    - `python setup.py upload`


## Generating Documentation

 - Generate on local for testing
    - `portray server`

 - Generate for production github page
    - Please make sure the docs look as expected on local
    - Checkout to existing branch `docs-site`
    - Run `portray as_html --overwrite` (Read [portray docs](https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/docs/quick_start/2.-cli/#outputting-documentation-locally) to know more)
    - That will generate html docs in `site/` directory, it will overwrite the existing content
    - Commit the changes and `git push origin `docs-site`
