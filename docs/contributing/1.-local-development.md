# Local Development

## Checklist before publishing the package

 - Make sure to update `REQUIRED` and `EXTRAS` lists in `setup.py` based on what's required by the library and what's required only for development. To ease local development, we will continue to maintain `requirements.txt` which includes every package.
 - Bump the version constant `VERSION` in `setup.py`
 - Run setup test
    - `python setup.py test`
 - Publish package to PyPI
    - `python setup.py upload`


## Generating Documentation

 - Generate on local for testing
    - `portray server`

 - Publishing the docs to [https://localcoinswap.github.io/kusama-utils/](https://localcoinswap.github.io/kusama-utils/)
    - Please make sure the docs look as expected on local
    - Checkout to `docs-branch` branch
      - Only difference between `master` and `docs-branch` is that the `site/` is not gitignored in `docs-branch`
    - Rebase `docs-branch` with `master`
    - Run `portray as_html --overwrite` (Read [portray docs](https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/docs/quick_start/2.-cli/#outputting-documentation-locally) to know more)
    - That will generate html docs in `site/` directory, it will overwrite the existing content
    - Commit the changes and push to `docs-branch` (Use `--force` since we rebased with `master`)
    - Run this nested git command to publish the changes in `gh-pages` branch (which serves the static html)

      ```
      git push origin `git subtree split --prefix site docs-branch`:gh-pages --force
      ```
