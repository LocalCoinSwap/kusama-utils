# Local Development

## Checklist before publishing the package

 - Install `pip install twine --dev`
 - Make sure to update `REQUIRED` and `EXTRAS` lists in `setup.py` based on what's required by the library and what's required only for development. To ease local development, we will continue to maintain `requirements.txt` which includes every package.
 - Bump the version constant `VERSION` in `setup.py`
 - Commit the version bump change in setup.py (It is okay to not push, but commit is required)
 - Run setup test
    - `python setup.py test`
 - Publish package to PyPI
    - `python setup.py upload`
 - Enter PyPi credentials (note: you must be added to the project as a maintainer)


## Generating Documentation

 - Generate on local for testing
    - `portray server`

 - Publishing the docs to [https://localcoinswap.github.io/substrate-utils/](https://localcoinswap.github.io/substrate-utils/)
    - Please make sure the docs look as expected on local
    - Checkout to `docs-branch` branch
        - `git checkout docs-branch`
        - Only difference between `master` and `docs-branch` is that the `site/` is not gitignored in `docs-branch`
    - Merge `master` into `docs-branch`
        - `git merge master`
        - Add the merge commit
    - Run `portray as_html --overwrite` (Read [portray docs](https://timothycrosley.github.io/portray/docs/quick_start/2.-cli/#outputting-documentation-locally) to know more)
    - That will generate html docs in `site/` directory, it will overwrite the existing content
    - Commit the changes and push to `docs-branch`
        - `git add site/`
        - `git commit`
        - `git push origin docs-branch`
    - Run this nested git command to publish the changes in `gh-pages` branch (which serves the static html)

      ```
      git push origin `git subtree split --prefix site docs-branch`:gh-pages --force
      ```
